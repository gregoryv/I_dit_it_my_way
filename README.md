In end of 2025 I decided to move away from github.com.

I've enjoyed the service greatly, even paid for it when I didn't have
to, it is that great.  However my projects are not widely used, and I
like to work in solitude. The project management features apart from git
I rarely use.

github pages has been ok, but I have this dry, numb feeling every time I
have to setup a new repository and the actions to create the pages. It's
just not personal enough.

So I decided it's time to move to a self hosted solution. The drawbacks
have been considered and I still think having a tech garden of my own
will be more fun. You are welcome to visit it at https://sogvin.com.

Projects at https://github.com/gregoryv will be archived and kept for
some time.  Most of them are further developed at sogvin.com.
