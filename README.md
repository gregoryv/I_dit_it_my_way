In end of 2025 I decided to move towards a self hosted solution over
github.com. The drawbacks have been considered and I still think having
a tech garden of my own will be more fun. You are welcome to visit it at
https://sogvin.com.

I've enjoyed the github service greatly, even paid for it when I didn't have
to.  However my projects are not widely used, and I rarely use the
various project management features of github.

Projects at https://github.com/gregoryv will be archived and kept for
some time.

As Frank Sinatra so elegantly sings; **I did it my way**

Thank you github!
